# Capital One 360 - Online Banking Statement Parser
Want to have all of your transactions ready to be imported into an application or ready to be processed in an easy to read and manipulatable format?
This is the application just for that! You will still have to download each statement for every month (though an auto-downloader is a WIP feature).

There will be several different formats. One is an excel spreadsheet where all transactions will be listed on one sheet as well as separate sheets 
based on each month's statement transactions.

## Note
After 01/31/2019, Capital One 360 started a new format for the online banking statements.
